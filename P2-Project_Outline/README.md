## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The project is to develop a "Reminder" service, called "Remind Me."
The user will enter events that she wants advanced reminders for.  The app
will place those events, both recurring and non-recurring, on her Google calendar 
and generate text reminders to her at dates/times  specified by her.  It will also place the event
on her Google calendar. Once an event and remimder schedule is set up the app 
will send text messages to her to remind her of the upcoming event. 
These reminders will be repeated based on her schedule.  As an example,
birthdays of loved ones reminders will occur annualy. The app will also accommodate
non-recurring eventys such as dentist appointments,meetings and conference calls.
Users will appreciate the timely reminders of important occasions, allowing them to
prepare for the occasionas, as well as relieving them of the anxiety of the possibility
of forgetting such an occasion.

The idea came to me when I realized I had forgotten an important occcasion despite the
fact that I had it in my calendar and did receive calendar app generated alerts.  
Unfortunately, those alerts are bundled in with many other alerts I receieve:  news alerts,
sports alerts and social media alerts.  Clearly these alerts are not effective.

I believe an automated, reliable, inexpensive sms/text alert is the most effective way
to be reminded of events.

### Features
User Login - the user will  be able to create an account and login to the application.  Each
user will have a home page showing the Email ID associated with their Google calendar
and the mobile phone number the reminder text mnessages will be sent to.

Reminder Scheduling - the user will be able to schedule a reminder for any event 
they choose.

Display,Edit and Delete - the user will be able to display all reminders she has scheduled. 
She will also be able to edit or delete any reminder she has scheduled

### Technologies
C#
ASP.NET Core
Razor templates
MySql as part of ASP.NET Core


### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to use the Google Calenmdar API and the API for 
the SMS/Text service I will be using.
